## 🌳 Our Digital Ecosystem



Ecolaura isn't just another e-commerce platform; it's a thriving digital forest where sustainable products and eco-conscious consumers come together to nurture a greener future. Our infrastructure is designed with the same care and consideration for sustainability that goes into every product we feature.



### 🌍 Our Mission



To create a resilient, scalable, and eco-friendly digital platform that:

- Minimizes our carbon footprint

- Maximizes efficiency and user experience

- Serves as a model for sustainable web infrastructure



## 🚀 Getting Started



Ready to join our band of digital eco-warriors? Here's how to get this green machine up and running on your local environment:



1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash

  git clone https://github.com/ecolaura/infrastructure.git

  cd infrastructure

```



2. **Set Up Your Tool Belt**

  Ensure you have the following installed:

  - Docker 🐳

  - Kubernetes (kubectl) ☸️

  - Terraform 🏗️

  - AWS CLI 🔧



3. **Configure Your AWS Credentials**

```bash

  aws configure

```



4. **Initialize Terraform**

```bash

  cd terraform

  terraform init

```



5. **Grow Your Local Environment**

```bash

  docker-compose up -d

```



And voila! You've just planted the seeds of your very own Ecolaura forest. Watch it grow!



## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components



Our digital ecosystem is composed of several key biomes, each playing a crucial role in the overall health of our platform:



### 🌱 Frontend (React.js)

The lush canopy of our forest, providing a beautiful and intuitive interface for our users to explore sustainable products.



### 🌲 Backend (Python Flask)

The strong trunk of our tree, processing requests and managing the core logic of our platform.



### 🗄️ Database (PostgreSQL)

The roots of our ecosystem, storing and managing data with the efficiency of nature itself.



### ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)

The sky and soil that nourish our digital forest, providing scalable and reliable resources.



### 🐳 Containerization (Docker)

The seeds of our application, encapsulating our services for easy planting and transplanting.



### ☸️ Orchestration (Kubernetes)

The gardener of our infrastructure, ensuring our containers are healthy, balanced, and thriving.



### 🔍 Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)

The watchful eyes and ears of our forest, alert to any disturbances in the ecosystem.



## 🚀 Deployment



Bringing new life to our digital forest is an exciting process! Check out our \[Deployment Guide\](docs/deployment_guide.md) for step-by-step instructions on how to nurture new growth in our ecosystem.



Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Always test in our digital nursery (staging environment) before introducing new species to our main forest (production)!



## 🔧 Monitoring and Maintenance



A healthy forest requires constant care and attention. Our [Infrastructure Overview](docs/infrastructure_overview.md) provides insights into how we keep our digital ecosystem thriving:



- 🌡️ Health Checks: Regular check-ups on all our digital flora and fauna

- 🌪️ Load Balancing: Ensuring no single tree bears too much weight

- 🐛 Log Management: Keeping a watchful eye for any pesky bugs

- 🌱 Auto-scaling: Allowing our forest to grow naturally with demand



## 🆘 Disaster Recovery



Even the mightiest redwoods can fall. But fear not! Our \[Disaster Recovery Plan\](docs/disaster\_recovery.md) ensures that we can weather any storm:



- 🌊 Backup Strategies: Creating seeds from our existing flora

- 🔥 Recovery Procedures: Regrowing from the ashes if disaster strikes

- 🌈 Failover Mechanisms: Ensuring the sun always shines on our forest



## 🤝 Contributing



We believe in the power of community to create a more sustainable world. If you'd like to contribute to our digital forest, check out our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). Whether you're planting new seeds (features) or pruning existing branches (bug fixes), your help in growing our ecosystem is always appreciated!

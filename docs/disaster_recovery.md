# 🌿 Ecolaura Disaster Recovery Plan: Weathering the Digital Storm



## 🌍 Introduction: Preparing for Nature's Curveballs



In the digital ecosystem of Ecolaura, just as in nature, we must be prepared for unexpected events. This disaster recovery plan is our roadmap to resilience, ensuring that even in the face of digital tsunamis or cyber hurricanes, our sustainable platform stands strong. Let's dive into how we protect and preserve our digital forest.



## 🌱 Backup Procedures: Preserving Our Digital Seeds



### 🗄️ Database Backups: Safeguarding Our Data Roots

- 🌙 Full backups: Nightly at 1:00 AM UTC, like a digital full moon ritual

- 🕐 Incremental backups: Hourly, capturing the constant growth of our data

- 🗺️ Geo-redundancy: Stored in a separate AWS region, because even digital seeds need diversity

- 🗓️ Retention: 30 days for daily backups, 7 days for hourly - a digital seed bank for our data



### 📁 File Backups: Preserving Our Digital Leaves

- 📸 Daily snapshots: Taken at 2:00 AM UTC of user uploads and static files

- ☁️ Storage: Safely nestled in AWS S3 with versioning, like a digital time capsule

- 🗓️ Retention: 90 days - because digital seasons change slowly



### ⚙️ Configuration Backups: Backing Up Our Digital DNA

- 🧬 Version control: All Kubernetes manifests and configs are in Git

- 📦 Weekly backups: A separate backup of our entire Git repository, just in case



## 🔄 Recovery Procedures: Regrowing Our Digital Forest



### 🗄️ Database Recovery: Replanting Our Data Roots

1. 🛑 Pause the application - like calling a timeout in nature

2. 🔍 Identify the latest valid backup - finding the healthiest seed

3. 🌱 Restore to a new RDS instance - planting in fresh soil

4. ✅ Verify data integrity - ensuring our data sapling is healthy

5. 🔄 Update application config - redirecting the water supply

6. 🚀 Restart the application - let the new data tree flourish



### 🖥️ Application Recovery: Regenerating Our Digital Ecosystem

1. 🔐 Ensure all secrets and configs are up-to-date in Kubernetes - checking our digital soil nutrients

2. 🔄 Redeploy using latest known good images:

```bash

  kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/

```

3. 🔍 Verify functionality - like a digital botanist checking each leaf



### 🌳 Full System Recovery: Regrowing the Entire Forest

In case of a complete system failure (the digital equivalent of a forest fire):



1. 🏗️ Recreate Kubernetes cluster using Terraform - preparing new ground

2. 🔐 Restore all configurations and secrets - replanting our ecosystem's building blocks

3. 🗄️ Follow database recovery procedure - replanting our oldest, strongest trees

4. 🖥️ Follow application recovery procedure - filling in the rest of the forest

5. 🔀 Reconfigure DNS if necessary - updating nature's signposts



## 🔄 Failover Procedures: Nature's Backup Plan



For critical components with hot standbys (like backup trees in a forest):



1. 🗄️ Database Failover:

  - 🤖 Automated failover configured for RDS - like a digital forest fire response team

  - 👀 Manually verify successful failover - a forest ranger's check



2. 🖥️ Application Failover:

  - 🔄 Kubernetes auto-reschedules pods on healthy nodes - digital seeds finding new, fertile ground

  - 👀 Monitor and intervene if necessary - sometimes nature needs a helping hand



## 🧪 Testing: Simulating Nature's Challenges



### 📅 Regular Testing Schedule

- 🌓 Monthly: Database restore test - like a monthly health check for our data roots

- 🌎 Quarterly: Full application recovery test - a seasonal check-up for our entire digital ecosystem

- 🌞 Bi-annually: Complete disaster recovery drill - preparing for the digital equivalent of all four seasons in one day



### 🔬 Testing Procedure

1. 🏝️ Create a sandboxed environment - our digital test garden

2. 🌪️ Simulate a disaster scenario - unleash a controlled digital storm

3. 🔧 Execute recovery procedures - our digital forest restoration process

4. ✅ Verify system functionality and data integrity - checking every digital leaf and branch

5. 📝 Document results and issues - writing our digital nature journal

6. 📊 Update this plan based on findings - evolving with our ecosystem



## 📢 Communication Plan: The Forest's Emergency Broadcast System



When disaster strikes:



1. 🚨 On-call engineer assesses and initiates recovery - our first responder

2. 📊 Regular stakeholder updates via established channels - keeping everyone informed about our forest's health

3. 🔍 Post-recovery analysis - understanding how our ecosystem weathered the storm



## 🔄 Plan Maintenance: Nurturing Our Recovery Abilities



- 🔄 Quarterly review and updates - seasonal check-ups for our recovery plan

- 🎓 Annual team training - teaching all our gardeners how to weather a storm

- 🔍 Infrastructure changes trigger plan reviews - our plan evolves as our forest grows



Remember, in the Ecolaura ecosystem, disaster recovery isn't just about bouncing back - it's about growing stronger. Like a forest after a fire, we aim to emerge more resilient and vibrant than ever before. Stay green, stay resilient! 🌿💪
